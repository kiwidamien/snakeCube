# snakeCube

An implementation of the snake on a "cube net" i.e. the flattened version of a piece of paper that you fold up to get a cube.

Does not include a timer to automatically move the snake forward. It is intended to help users understand the geometry of the cube. In particular, visualizing how the snake head changes direction as it moves between faces is quite challenging.


Inspired by the [snakeCube CodeFights problem](https://codefights.com/challenge/93CBnFa2vWyivpdHE).
